<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let a = "It's alright";
let b = "He is called 'Manoj'";
let c = 'He is called "Bunny"';

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
a + "<br>" + 
b + "<br>" + 
c;
</script>
